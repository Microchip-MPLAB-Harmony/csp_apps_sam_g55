# RSTC interrupt

This example shows how to use the RSTC peripheral to generate an interrupt instead of generating a reset, when the Reset switch is pressed on board.

## Description

The RSTC peripheral samples the Reset input (NRST pin) at slow clock speed. When the line is detected low, it resets the processor and the peripherals. However, the RSTC peripheral can be programmed to not trigger a reset when an assertion of NRST occurs. The Reset pin state can be read at any time in software or it can also be programmed to generate an interrupt
instead of generating a reset.
